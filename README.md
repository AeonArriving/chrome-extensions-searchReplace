## Why is there this project?

When doing product ppt, some nouns in certain pages need to be replaced uniformly. I also found some plug-ins in the Google expansion store, such as two plug-ins with a higher download volume: 1. Find & Replace for Text Editing 2. FindR. But these two plug-ins have problems. After the first plug-in replaces the text, all button hyperlinks cannot be clicked. The second plugin cannot be replaced at all, and it seems to be no longer maintained. So I decided to develop a plugin to complete this task.

## How to use?

- step1: git clone https://github.com/Summer-andy/chrome-extensions-searchReplace
- step2: In Google browser entry  ``` chrome://extensions/ ```, Open developer mode„ÄÇ
- step3: Click the load decompressed program button, choose chrome-extensions-searchReplace file„ÄÇ
